This arrangement ensures that the farmer gets his money at the time he needs it most—when the season starts—and is able to work his farm without worry: any uncontrollable crop failures will not hurt his livelihood. Customers get a commitment from the farmer that he will do his best because they have trusted him with their money, and they receive the freshest, seasonal food that money can buy, straight from the source, week in and week out. Often with larger CSAs, the farmer brings the weekly boxes into town for pick up; some farms allow visitors or u-pick, or exchange labor for produce."

Beer-drinkers (and other fun people) everywhere are having a blast with the idea while creating books for kids that have limited access to educational resources. The basic idea of ""B4B"" is that you find a cool bar/restaurant in your neighborhood which agrees to donate $1 for every drink sold on a specific night, you invite all your friends, and every $1 funds a high quality local language book for kids via Room to Read. Since February 2009 we've created over 100,000 books for kids just by hanging out and having a good time. It's an easy way to do good and learn about the amazing work of Room to Read with fun people."

The result provides capitals and global institutions with a deeper understanding of the circumstances shaping policy choices worldwide as well as a flow of new approaches to policy problems.Today, Carnegie has research centers in Beijing, Beirut, Brussels, Moscow, and Washington as well as a program in Almaty. It is supervised by an international board of trustees and its research activities are overseen by a global management group. More than two-thirds of its current scholars were born outside the United States, nearly all speak languages other than their native tongues, and most have had experience in government. The global think tank has websites in Arabic, Chinese, English, and Russian. Carnegie does not take institutional positions, does not engage in lobbying, and is not involved in ideological advocacy. Instead, it relies on its independence and the quality of its scholarship to make notable contributions to national policymaking. It welcomes scholars with diverse political views and is acknowledged to be a centrist institution within the American political spectrum."

We are looking to connect mainly with fashion designers and clothing line owners whereby we could make their clothes to their exact specifications and designs, but at a very competitive price. This is because we are situated in Bangladesh, which is one of the largest garment exporting countries of the world and where labour costs and thus production costs are extremely low. We are strictly long term and have been in the business for many years having built a sound reputation throughout the world. So we are not interested in any short cuts, are very happy to compete for business and will try more to offer benefit to our partners in order to benefit ourselves. It costs nothing to request a quotation. No commitment is necessary, but you will find that we try much more than others and therefore hope to offer a great deal. Moreover, our quotations are itemized so it is useful to compare with my competitors to see where we are cheaper and where, by chance, we are not. It is certainly useful in reaching a final price and shaving cents off. Regarding SOCIAL NETWORKing, I, personally, am very new to this type of marketing and will undoubtedly make many mistakes, but hope you will forgive me, or better still, perhaps point me in the right direction.

With a B.A. in Community Psychology and a minor in Environmental Studies, I decided to throw caution to the wind and travel the world. During five years of independent, international travel and development work experience, I lived in Laos and launched one of South East Asia's first community performance spaces, created and taught the region's first college course in Sustainable Development through partnership with environmental NGOs, served as a trainee in the Peace Corps in Senegal as an Environmental Educator, and worked in Berlin as the Development Director for the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy. Upon return to the U.S., I worked extensively in several related social enterprise, travel and green companies and startups to build the foundation in business development needed to launch any venture. After designing and delivering various business and marketing strategies for startups and sustainable ventures, I traveled towards my true passion and founded Travelcology in fall of 2007, a venture to retool tourism into a vehicle for positive social change. When the world economy plummeted, this global vision was put on hold, to consult other startups, and then to cofound Open Venture Society, an open source web firm geared to provide web services to socially responsible ventures. In winter of '09, a new cofounder appeared to picked up the travel venture where I left off and is leading our partnership in launching Travelcology. Which brings us to the next project on the horizon, Third Rail Ventures, just taking shape as the lovely culmination of all of the above."

Only to be discarded, thrown into landfills, onto our streets, and into our Ecosystems. These bottles don’t degrade. And the few that are recycled only increase the overall carbon footprint.Even local water supplies are filled with trace amounts of chemicals, hormones, even prescription drugs.It doesn’t have to be this way. At EcoloBlue we have developed a unique, powerful, and responsible way to tap into this vast resource of the trillions of gallons of water in the atmosphere.But we don’t stop there.

Musicians publish a new album with sponsorship from brands. No corporate sell-out - musicians take full control over choosing sponsors. Brands sponsor a new album and win the hearts of enthusiastic music fans of the musician. Associating with new album release is a great way to create buzz. Rather than having brands pay for advertising spots on music destination sites, brands set up a pool of funds for a branding campaign and â??inviteâ? only those musicians that they feel best portray their brand image. Invited musicians have the right to accept or refuse the invitation, and a sponsorship relationship is formed when mutual consent is reached. (just like â??friendship requestâ?? in facebook) The branding fund is then allocated among the invited musicians based on the number of plays. Both brands and bands have the incentive to engage their social media network to drive traffic to the newly formed relationship, creating a win-win scenario for both parties. Musicians take 70% of the total sponsorship revenue and fanatic.fm takes 30%. And then musicians and us donate 2.5% each (5% in total) to charities that musicians select to help them change the world."

Incorporate â??triple bottom lineâ? analysis, seeking to balance economic, social and environmental considerations into all city policy and program decisions. Set clear metrics of success and report on our progress moving forward through annual report cards. Pursue activities that support environmental equity and health for all citizens. Partner with community organizations, cultural institutions and businesses to achieve broad impact. Lead by example in city practice wherever possible."

This waste has always been a dilemma for operators, not only from a financial point of view, but also seen from an environmental aspect. GreenSeatFinder is now here to change that, with a booking engine for these empty return trips, or Green Seats as we call them. Not only for the passenger transport sector, but also for the shipping sector. GreenSeatFinder therefore presents the unique concept of collecting â?allâ? of these empty trips under the very same umbrella. A winning concept, where the â?Operatorsâ? get paid again for their return trips and boost their green image, as well as reaching out to new groups of travelers. The most important outcome of all is that we considerably reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere ."

So it felt vital to create places around the world for accessing space, resources, connections, knowledge, experience and investment. We've been working across four continents, and 12 cities to create places for people who change things. This is the ambition. We set out to create places that borrow from the best of a member's club, an innovation agency, a serviced office and a think-tank to create a very different kind of innovation environment. Places with all the tools and trimmings needed to grow and develop new ventures. Places to access experience, knowledge, finance and markets. And above all, places for experience and encounter, full of diverse people doing amazing things. We call these places Hubs. In many ways we're just getting started.

Every two months our project takes place at a beautiful and inspiring spot somewhere in the world to write, produce and record an entire album. If possible we will present the written and recorded music in one or more live performances at suitable venues after the recordings have ended."

We recognized that vehicles are ubiquitous in urban environments & they just aren't easily accessible because individuals own them. We provide a secure, safe and insured mechanism for individual vehicle owners to offer their vehicles into a common pool while providing the individual with a variety of controls for managing the usage profile, both in terms of drivers and driving styles. Benefits of the JustShareIt framework are many. Vehicles, mostly depreciating assets, are significantly underutilized, often sitting idle outside work or home 90% of the time. We provide an out-the-door solution for those that may choose to not own a car and an income stream from a high cost personal asset for those that choose to own a car and typically households spend $700 a month on vehicle ownership and maintenance. Parking, traffic and consequent environmental impact reductions are a desirable outcome for many urban environments suffering from congested roadways, offering city governments a new approach to addressing these issues while also offering their fleets into the community as well. To Us, access to vehicles is about more than just transportation, it's about adventure. With our service, we enable the communication between members to share their assets. Non-vehicle owners can have access to other members' private cars or other vehicles, while others can leverage their depreciating assets by renting their vehicles out, or borrowing equal or higher value assets at lower rates. The opportunity for an affordable experience with any type of vehicle is now also within reach. By encouraging sharing, we hope to create a more trusting community while making an impact on the environment (land/sea) - with less wasteful consumption, less congestion and less pollution. Imagine a nice weekend getaway on a boat, or running quick errands without owning a second car."

The Kern Green business certification is a structured program that provides tools, resources, and technical support for businesses that want a targeted approach to greening their operations. Kern Green Mission To engage individuals and businesses to take greater responsibility for improving their environment through education and awareness that will contribute to the economic vitality and environmental conservation of our region. Kern Green Purpose The Green Business Certification program through KernGreen creates incentives for businesses integrate current and future guidelines into daily operations. Since the program is complimentary, businesses of all sizes have the same access to information and support. Kern Green embraces the concept of Triple Bottom Line â?? People, Planet, Profit, with solutions that target environmental as well as economical benefits. It aims to create healthier workspaces and has the potential to dramatically improve air quality and attract the quality workforce needed to expand economic growth throughout Kern County. Why Green Kern County? Natural resources and natural beauty are an inherent part of the County of Kern. However, with this natural beauty comes its own challenges. Mountain ranges that trap polluted air in the valleys in which the majority of our residents inhabit, and therefore breathe. Open spaces that attracted growth in the form of sprawling development that requires people to drive for most of their daily activities. Affordable land that has been a boon to industry yet contributor to poor air quality and threat to water quality as well as the health of the regionâ??s residents. These challenges are increasingly common throughout many areas of the United States, but that does not mean they should be ignored. The Kern Green program provides education and resources for businesses and residents to reduce their environmental impact and improve quality of life in the region."

I wanted to have a blog where I could post photos and share crazy stories so that my friends and family could follow along from afar.I thought I would return to lawyering after a year or so on the road, but as you know (since you’re reading this now), a return to the law never happened. This is my vaguely chronological recounting of my time living and eating abroad. It is mostly about the stories, so while I do post as I discover new places, I often share stories from earlier in my travels several years later.

You disclose deep-rooted secrets. You find yourself in a new world with new people and new coffee cultures. Even when you are alone with a cup of coffee, something is happening. Some may call it a caffeine addiction, but I choose to see it as a bonding experience. People don’t take enough time to appreciate their daily coffee rituals!

Some of us on this side of the Atlantic liked the sound of that and we thought London could do something similar. With Dave Eggers' blessing, and led by writer Nick Hornby, we set up shop in Hoxton High Street. The Hoxton Street Monster Supplies sells everything that any monster needs. But there's more to it than keeping monsters stocked with the goods of their best nightmares. Behind the shelves of monster supplies, there's an entrance to another secret place. The Ministry of Stories. And that's official."

In Trondheim City plastic and paper are collected from households by the municipality and but the households have to return glass and metal containers themselves. The latter happens only with 50 % of the garbage, which constitutes a fundamental societal and environmental problem. Panterne will give drug addicts an opportunity to show that they are willing, and able, to do a honest line of work by contributing to solve this problem. The workers will be provided uniforms, trolleys and maps so that they can collect bottles and cans from households that are subscribers of the service. We hope this extra income, and the fact that they contribute to solving a important societal problem will provide the workers with self esteem, dignity and optimism about their own situation. Like in many other countries, Norwegian customers must pay a container deposit of NOK 1,- when purchasing beer or soft drinks to ensure that bottles and cans are returned and recycled. This deposit will be collected by the workers when they return the bottles and cans to the stores. This money will go directly to the collectors. The municipality will pay the service NOK 0,71 per. kilogram of non-returnable goods (glass and metal for which no deposit has been paid). This money will be used for administrating and marketing the service. After a period of working for Panterne, the drug-addicts will be given the opportunity to apply for jobs trough our associated partners, mostly businesses and organizations that already to some degree employ people with different difficulties."

Our vision is to have the world's most comprehensive geo-coded directory, including micro-businesses (home-based) that are lacking or under-represented in other directories and search engines, and we want this to be in a social environment where YOU can add listings ratings, content, friends, etc. SocialStreets is currently serving over 32 million geocoded listings in the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States. At the heart of SocialStreets lies two key technologies: A Community Value Index (CVI) engine which will enable businesses to have fairly equal exposure and also allows users to see what is most relevant to them within their locality. This among others features, exposes business listing owners to their clients and target audiences in a much more intelligent manner. The CVI engine creates a ""credit score"" for social value within a local community. A User Experience Tracker (UET) which tracks all user interactions within SocialStreets. As the user's data grows, the meta data is fed into our UET engine with refines and makes the search results more and more personalized. Each registered user has access to their unique UET ""memories"" via a dynamic tag cloud. Our interface is very simple and a new business can be added in less than 5 minutes. Our search technology also allows end-users to view search results in different view formats (map, flow, list, and tag cloud) using the same result sets."

All the tee shirts we make are made with organic cotton, designed by independent Sydney-based creatives , and printed on home soil in Australia. The concept of the brand is simple: great designs, great quality and an organic product at a low price. At STOC, we love to do things a little differently. Our real interest is design, and we are always on the hunt for all things cool and fresh that excite us. Our work is creating unique tees we love to wear and other people want to see. We want to work with people that are fun on a product that we love. What makes a good design is up to each individual, but we at STOC think itâ??s more than just acting as a walking billboard for a label. We collaborate with the artists we work with, and each design gets scanned and loved by us before it gets printed. Thanks for looking and enjoy the tees! Victoria & Carl @ Stoc"

Weâ??ve found from feedback weâ??ve got from our users that for many of them this is indeed something they place an emphasis on in their own experiences.

Whether we're building our partners' capacity to use video in their campaigns, holding training sessions with activists from all over the world, or participating in shared learning online, we are enabling more and more activists to bring their own human rights stories into the open to campaign for change. The rise of technology has allowed the world to participate in video advocacy. But with new technology and new ways to communicate, there is also a need for a better way to protect the safety, dignity and human rights of all. In this new environment, WITNESS is playing a key role to influence and shape practices around the safe use of video online and offline. While WITNESS is working to secure the future of human rights video, we are also helping to preserve its past. Human rights videos serve as a living record of history and can be a vital component in the prosecution of crimes. The WITNESS Media Archive contains thousands of hours of human rights video and is dedicated to the preservation and accessing of rare and politically sensitive media. It is one of the most diverse and important human rights video collections in the world and an invaluable resource to a global community. Its existence ensures that the history of these abuses is never forgotten and, hopefully, never repeated."

Given the amazing technology that exists today, it just didn't make sense that real-time and trustworthy sourcing of work and workers was so far off the mark. Even when your physical well-being is not at stake with such other services, you still need to care for your poor inbox that will be berrated and spammed for weeks on end, often from â??Nigerian princesâ? looking to make you a deal. And thus the idea was born. As the team set out building Workables (formerly known as Turbo140 during beta), our mission is to bring liquidity and transparency to ghastly inefficient markets. The result is a real-time marketplace for one-time jobs and micro-tasks that are completed locally, virtually, and sometimes both. Unlike our competitors who create directories from which users are forced to shop and scour along a tedious and boolean path, Workables puts the onus on services providers (professional and amateur alike) to win their business. Workables allows users who are looking to find workers to quickly and simply post what they need. Combining our networks and social reach with the usersâ??, Workables then creates a transparent and trustworthy marketplace, resulting in the best value and best experience for YOU - the customer."
