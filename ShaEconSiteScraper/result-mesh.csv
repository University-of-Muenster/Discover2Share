As aquarium hobbyists we have long been aware that most retail stock comes (for the most part) from harmful ocean harvest practices such as drag netting. Additionally, new stock is often stressed or diseased and could die within weeks of purchase (though typically not at the retail level).Years of participating in the online commercial and advanced hobbyist marine breeders forum and discussion boards has yielded many unique methods in aquaculture which we've sorted through to develop a scalable system suitable for bulk marine species production.Aurora Corals has two published, laboratory trained scientists (John and Stephen) on staff and will set up a small, but effective, wet-lab for quality and process control.We are headquartered in Ottawa which is a significant advantage for us because of new Canadian laws coming into effect which will further restrict imports and increase delays and paperwork for Canadian retailers. These import restrictions will drive up the demand for Canadian suppliers while not preventing us from selling into the broader US market. Aurora Corals will produce captive bred/propagated bulk Live Foods, Invertebrates, Fish and Coral Fragments (also known as frags) to meet the newly unsatisfied demand resulting from these regulation changes. Aurora Corals is run under the direction of Kevin Turnbull, Stephen Turnbull and their father John Turnbull with the assistance of Andrew Moffat, Cecily Wallace, and many others. Together we will fill the predicted supply void while educating salt water aquarium owners and retailers to the benefits of a convenient, predictable Canadian supply of healthy, tank reared animals."

The parcels therefore find their natural ways through the city or to the next logistic hub, where they can be picked up by professional carriers. bring.BUDDIES identify themselves via mobile phones when they pick up or drop a packet. If they want to participate they just turn on a bring.BUDDY-App on their cell phone. The altruistic idea behind bring.BUDDY is to enable people to help other people. But by carrying parcels bring.BUDDIES can also foster financial efficiencies: They collect points which then can be redeemed for other bring.BUDDY services, public transport tickets or products at bring.BUDDY partner stores.

This is because we are situated in Bangladesh, which is one of the largest garment exporting countries of the world and where labour costs and thus production costs are extremely low.We are strictly long term and have been in the business for many years having built a sound reputation throughout the world. So we are not interested in any short cuts, are very happy to compete for business and will try more to offer benefit to our partners in order to benefit ourselves.It costs nothing to request a quotation. No commitment is necessary, but you will find that we try much more than others and therefore hope to offer a great deal. Moreover, our quotations are itemized so it is useful to compare with my competitors to see where we are cheaper and where, by chance, we are not. It is certainly useful in reaching a final price and shaving cents off.Regarding social networking, I, personally, am very new to this type of marketing and will undoubtedly make many mistakes, but hope you will forgive me, or better still, perhaps point me in the right direction. Having said this, I am making some success in connecting to the right people, but I guess I have a lot more to learn."

With a B.A. in Community Psychology and a minor in Environmental Studies, I decided to throw caution to the wind and travel the world.During five years of independent, international travel and development work experience, I lived in Laos and launched one of South East Asia's first community performance spaces, created and taught the region's first college course in Sustainable Development through partnership with environmental NGOs, served as a trainee in the Peace Corps in Senegal as an Environmental Educator, and worked in Berlin as the Development Director for the Institute for Cultural Diplomacy.Upon return to the U.S., I worked extensively in several related social enterprise, travel and green companies and startups to build the foundation in business development needed to launch any venture. After designing and delivering various business and marketing strategies for startups and sustainable ventures, I traveled towards my true passion and founded Travelcology in fall of 2007, a venture to retool tourism into a vehicle for positive social change.When the world economy plummeted, this global vision was put on hold, to consult other startups, and then to cofound Open Venture Society, an open source web firm geared to provide web services to socially responsible ventures. In winter of '09, a new cofounder appeared to picked up the travel venture where I left off and is leading our partnership in launching Travelcology. Which brings us to the next project on the horizon, Third Rail Ventures, just taking shape as the lovely culmination of all of the above."

No corporate sell-out - musicians take full control over choosing sponsors.Brands sponsor a new album and win the hearts of enthusiastic music fans of the musician. Associating with new album release is a great way to create buzz.Rather than having brands pay for advertising spots on music destination sites, brands set up a pool of funds for a branding campaign and â€œinviteâ€ only those musicians that they feel best portray their brand image.Invited musicians have the right to accept or refuse the invitation, and a sponsorship relationship is formed when mutual consent is reached. (just like â€˜friendship requestâ€™ in facebook)The branding fund is then allocated among the invited musicians based on the number of plays. Both brands and bands have the incentive to engage their social media network to drive traffic to the newly formed relationship, creating a win-win scenario for both parties.Musicians take 70% of the total sponsorship revenue and fanatic.fm takes 30%.

We all know the world has it’s own idea of homeschoolers, but we believe we can recapture and redeem that identity.We’re committed to Creating Community. While homeschoolers come in many shapes and sizes, we all draw strength and encouragement from each other. Homeschoolers are by nature independent minded, yet we’re also interdependent on one another.We’re impacting our communities by raising a new generation of individual, independent thinkers. As we become more visible in the public square, we’re Raising Awareness about non-traditional educational alternatives.And finally, we believe that we are Changing Culture through home education. Our legacy as homeschoolers is the next generation that we raise. Our legacy as a company is how we can help.Why T-shirts? Well, besides the fact that we love wearing T-shirts, we know that in today’s culture, people identify themselves with the cars they drive to the coffee they drink and everything in between. So we’re using mediums of the popular culture to redeem the world’s perception of homeschoolers.Our designs seek to engage and challenge the broader culture in a friendly and whimsical way. We are all ambassadors for the homeschool community.Yes, we know that’s a lot for a little T-shirt company! But building a business on small dreams just isn’t our style. We’re running our businesslike we’re raising our families. You see, our vision is to change the face of home education. And when you wear a Homeskoolie T-shirt, you’re making that vision a reality!"

We provide a secure, safe and insured mechanism for individual vehicle owners to offer their vehicles into a common pool while providing the individual with a variety of controls for managing the usage profile, both in terms of drivers and driving styles.Benefits of the JustShareIt framework are many. Vehicles, mostly depreciating assets, are significantly underutilized, often sitting idle outside work or home 90% of the time. We provide an out-the-door solution for those that may choose to not own a car and an income stream from a high cost personal asset for those that choose to own a car and typically households spend $700 a month on vehicle ownership and maintenance. Parking, traffic and consequent environmental impact reductions are a desirable outcome for many urban environments suffering from congested roadways, offering city governments a new approach to addressing these issues while also offering their fleets into the community as well. To Us, access to vehicles is about more than just transportation, it's about adventure.  With our service, we enable the communication between members to share their assets. Non-vehicle owners can have access to other members' private cars or other vehicles, while others can leverage their depreciating assets by renting their vehicles out, or borrowing equal or higher value assets at lower rates. The opportunity for an affordable experience with any type of vehicle is now also within reach.By encouraging sharing, we hope to create a more trusting community while making an impact on the environment (land/sea) - with less wasteful consumption, less congestion and less pollution. Imagine a nice weekend getaway on a boat, or running quick errands without owning a second car."

Since the program is complimentary, businesses of all sizes have the same access to information and support. Kern Green embraces the concept of Triple Bottom Line â€“ People, Planet, Profit, with solutions that target environmental as well as economical benefits. It aims to create healthier workspaces and has the potential to dramatically improve air quality and attract the quality workforce needed to expand economic growth throughout Kern County.Why Green Kern County?Natural resources and natural beauty are an inherent part of the County of Kern.  However, with this natural beauty comes its own challenges. Mountain ranges that trap polluted air in the valleys in which the majority of our residents inhabit, and therefore breathe. Open spaces that attracted growth in the form of sprawling development that requires people to drive for most of their daily activities. Affordable land that has been a boon to industry yet contributor to poor air quality and threat to water quality as well as the health of the regionâ€™s residents. These challenges are increasingly common throughout many areas of the United States, but that does not mean they should be ignored.

And we know others do too, so we aim to help young people write their own stories. Why? Well, let's start with a true story...Once there was a shop in San Francisco. It sold everything a pirate might need. And if you went through the Pirate Shop you'll find young people writing stories, taking part in workshops and word games, receiving one-to-one mentoring from adult writers who volunteered their time. 826 Valencia was the brainchild of Dave Eggers, himself a successful writer, and educator NÃ­nive Calegari. Soon shops with writing centres attached opened up in Los Angeles, Brooklyn and other parts of the USA.Some of us on this side of the Atlantic liked the sound of that and we thought London could do something similar. With Dave Eggers' blessing, and led by writer Nick Hornby, we set up shop in Hoxton High Street. The Hoxton Street Monster Supplies sells everything that any monster needs.But there's more to it than keeping monsters stocked with the goods of their best nightmares. Behind the shelves of monster supplies, there's an entrance to another secret place.The Ministry of Stories.And that's official."

We connect people looking for a place to work with organizations that have workspaces to share. There are 10-40 million* mobile workers in the US alone and over 2 million workspaces that go unused every day. These workspaces include cubicles, desks, offices, conference rooms, and state of the art video conference centers. OpenDesks is a secure, cost-effective, and easy to use platform that makes it possible to share, find, and reserve shared workspaces. Users are freelancers, creative independents, startups, small teams, entrepreneurs, solo professionals (psychologists, lawyers), and field-based team members of larger companies, who need professional workspaces on demand. OpenDesks provides the flexibility of avoiding leases, having access to many different locations, choosing space for your needs today, and paying only for the time you use. Providers are organizations that have available resources they choose to share. Some are commercial shared workspaces, like coworking sites and office suites. Others are private offices that share certain resources (a desk, a conference room) with members. Some share resources privately, within their own organization, or with only a select group of people (business partners, customers, vendors). In order to build a marketplace for shared workspaces, we created a system to manage them. One that securely registers individuals and helps providers screen them, makes it easy for users to find and book resources, and is lean and efficient to keep costs down. More and more people are becoming independent workers, members of small teams, or mobile workers with no fixed workspace. OpenDesks makes it possible for them to find a place to work, anywhere, anytime - securely, efficiently, and cost-effectively."

The latter happens only with 50 % of the garbage, which constitutes a fundamental societal and environmental problem.Panterne will give drug addicts an opportunity to show that they are willing, and able, to do a honest line of work by contributing to solve this problem.The workers will be provided uniforms, trolleys and maps so that they can collect bottles and cans from households that are subscribers of the service. We hope this extra income, and the fact that they contribute to solving a important societal problem will provide the workers with self esteem, dignity and optimism about their own situation.Like in many other countries, Norwegian customers must pay a container deposit of NOK 1,- when purchasing beer or soft drinks to ensure that bottles and cans are returned and recycled. This deposit will be collected by the workers when they return the bottles and cans to the stores. This money will go directly to the collectors.The municipality will pay the service NOK 0,71 per. kilogram of non-returnable goods (glass and metal for which no deposit has been paid). This money will be used for administrating and marketing the service.After a period of working for Panterne, the drug-addicts will be given the opportunity to apply for jobs trough our associated partners, mostly businesses and organizations that already to some degree employ people with different difficulties."

We share vehicles in comercial and residencial buildings here in Brazil (we aim to expand to other countries soon!). Imagine a family with only one car (very common, right?). They live in their flat, with only one garage. In Brazil and in many countries, the usual thing this family would do is buying a second car as soon as they can. But, if their residential building offers them a car sharing service, they might not need this second car! This will save them a lot of money, help avoid big traffic jams and be more environmentally friendly. That's what we do, we aim to make life easier to people, by reducing their costs, giving them more free time, and freedom!"

Instead, we believe that communities can be the best source for the energy, encouragement, tools and capital small business entrepreneurs need to succeed.So, why canâ€™t anyone just invest a few hundred dollars in a small business they love? Weâ€™ve heard hundreds of stories from entrepreneurs and small business owners who have tried gathering investments (real investments, not just donations) from friends, family, and other members of their community, but have struggled along the way. Unfortunately, the process is unnecessarily confusing, costly, and complicated.ProFounder will change this.

With access to art, theater, music and restaurants, there's an energy that pulses through the community. We design our bags for people who thrive on the urban experience and celebrate the creative spirit.We're a new company, but we have many years of experience designing and manufacturing great bags and providing unique customer experiences. In addition to our passion for bags, we share a strong set of humanistic, environmental and social values that guide the way we conduct every aspect of our business. The name of our company derives from three Japanese characters meaning ""human powered vehicle""â€“ delightfully apropos for a company making bags for bicycle enthusiasts, and our metaphor for the strength of the human spirit.We're excited to embark on our new entrepreneurial adventure, and we look forward to seeing people carrying our bags on the city streets soon."

The added benefit is that a family does not need to buy a new hat or jumper every time one goes missing.StrayHat has developed a range of name labels with embedded codes. These are read by the StrayHat smartphone app to inform an owner where lost items are and which child in the family an item belongs to.

As Rob from the movie High Fidelity says -""I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like... Books, records, films â€” these things matter. Call me shallow but itâ€™s the fuckin' truth"".We started Tastebuds.fm to explore this idea. Weâ€™ve found from feedback weâ€™ve got from our users that for many of them this is indeed something they place an emphasis on in their own experiences. At the very least itâ€™s an interesting common ground to spark a conversation with someone which can be just as good a starting point as the fact that you both like red wine and walks along the beach."

That inspired us to create UpStart Bootcamp, with the goal of teaching founders everywhere how to start up smarter.When we started out as entrepreneurs, the world was different. Investors threw money at teams with unproven ideas. Technology had to be built from scratch. Getting consumer attention demanded expensive PR efforts. Changing course was slow and painful.Today, startups can move faster, with less capital. They start with rented technology, attract customers with social media, bootstrap through early stages, and keep their planning fast and flexible. These are the new rules of entrepreneurship.These rules arenâ€™t widely known beyond venture capital-backed tech startups. But over one million founders start companies every year with no formal business training, and little chance of raising venture capital.UpStart is leveling the playing field, making the new rules of entrepreneurship accessible to everyone. UpStart gives founders advice, inspiration and support through current materials, books, on-demand classes and personalized coaching."

For example, videos from these collaborations have helped shed light on the systemic repression of ethnic minorities in Burma, prosecute recruiters of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of Congo and pass the first law protecting elders from abuse in the US.   A key component of WITNESS' mission is to inspire and engage others to use video for change. We embrace a collaborative process that involves both teaching and learning from the human rights community. Whether we're building our partners' capacity to use video in their campaigns, holding training sessions with activists from all over the world, or participating in shared learning online, we are enabling more and more activists to bring their own human rights stories into the open to campaign for change. The rise of technology has allowed the world to participate in video advocacy. But with new technology and new ways to communicate, there is also a need for a better way to protect the safety, dignity and human rights of all. In this new environment, WITNESS is playing a key role to influence and shape practices around the safe use of video online and offline. While WITNESS is working to secure the future of human rights video, we are also helping to preserve its past. Human rights videos serve as a living record of history and can be a vital component in the prosecution of crimes. The WITNESS Media Archive contains thousands of hours of human rights video and is dedicated to the preservation and accessing of rare and politically sensitive media. It is one of the most diverse and important human rights video collections in the world and an invaluable resource to a global community. Its existence ensures that the history of these abuses is never forgotten and, hopefully, never repeated."

Given the amazing technology that exists today, it just didnâ€™t make sense that real-time and trustworthy sourcing of work and workers was so far off the mark. Even when your physical well-being is not at stake with such other services, you still need to care for your poor inbox that will be berrated and spammed for weeks on end, often from â€œNigerian princesâ€ looking to make you a deal. And thus the idea was born.As the team set out building Workables (formerly known as Turbo140 during beta), our mission is to bring liquidity and transparency to ghastly inefficient markets. The result is a real-time marketplace for one-time jobs and micro-tasks that are completed locally, virtually, and sometimes both. Unlike our competitors who create directories from which users are forced to shop and scour along a tedious and boolean path, Workables puts the onus on services providers (professional and amateur alike) to win their business. Workables allows users who are looking to find workers to quickly and simply post what they need. Combining our networks and social reach with the usersâ€™, Workables then creates a transparent and trustworthy marketplace, resulting in the best value and best experience for YOU - the customer."
